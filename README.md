# NG Workshop 02

## Task

In the [log-updates.directive.ts](src/app/log-updates.directive.ts) modify the `LogUpdatesDirective` in a way
that will allow you to:

- log `updateName` events that are coming from [HelloComponent](src/app/hello.component.ts)
- without modifying anything else

_HINT_: Events are streams - meaning more than one subscriber is allowed to listen to it. Use it!

## Serve

To serve the app, run:

```
ng serve
```

## Submission

Once you've come up with a solution (even if it breaks):

- create a new branch
- commit your changes
- push to remote repo
- open PR against upstream master

_NOTE_: It's alright if your solution does not work/build - the main
idea behind this exercise is to find gaps in explanations
and try and cover them in the next session!

Enjoy =)
